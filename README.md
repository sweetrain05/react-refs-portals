### üì£ About this webpage
- In this project, I practiced various usage of `useRef` hook and how to create Portal in react:
  - Difference between `useRef` vs. `useState`.
  - How to use `useRef` hook as variable (not for DOM connection).
  - How to use `forwardRef` to forward ref as props to other components.
  - How to use `<dialog>` to create Modal.
  - Use `useImperativeHandle` and `forwardRef` together hook to expose component API.
  - How to use `createPortal` in react-dom to transport jsx.
